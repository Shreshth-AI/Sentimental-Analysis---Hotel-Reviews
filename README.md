**Hotel Reviews - Sentient Analysis**

**Case and Problems**

• How can topic modeling be used to identify key themes in positive and negative hotel reviews?
• What preprocessing techniques (e.g., tokenization, stop-word removal) should be applied to ensure accurate sentiment analysis?
• What are the top three factors influencing customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction based on review data?
• How can sentiment analysis help hotel businesses improve customer experience and service quality?

**Analysis**

This analysis examines hotel customer reviews to identify key factors influencing satisfaction and dissatisfaction using sentiment analysis and topic modeling. The BING method was applied to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral, while Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) extracted common themes. Positive reviews highlighted room quality, staff service, and location, whereas negative reviews focused on cleanliness, staff behavior, and pricing issues. Clustering techniques further grouped related topics, providing actionable insights for hotels to enhance customer experience and service quality.
